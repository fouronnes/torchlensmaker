*Torch Lens Maker* is an open-source Python library for designing optical systems using optimization.

It is currently an experimental project, but under active development. The goal is to be able to design complex real-world optical systems using modern and expressive computer code.

* Describe your optical system in Python
* Choose what's fixed and what's an optimizable parameter (surfaces shapes, element positions, number of lenses, aperture sizes, etc.)
* Sample the problem space with a number of rays, wavelengths, elements positions, etc.
* Optimize parameters to maximize optical performance
* Analyse with ray error plots, ray diagrams, spot diagrams, and more
* Export ready to manufacture 3D models in any format

The core of the project is differentiable collision detection and ray-tracing implemented in PyTorch. PyTorch provides world-class automatic differentiation, and access to state-of-the-art numerical optimization algorithms. Export to 3D models is done with build123d.

The key idea is that there is a strong analogy to be made between layers of a neural network, and optical elements in an optical system. If we have an optical system made of a series of lenses, mirrors, etc, we can pretend that each optical element is the layer of a neural network. The data flowing through this network are not images, sounds, text or whatever it is neural networks do these days, but rays of light. Each layer affects light rays depending on its internal parameters describing its surface shape, and following the very much non-linear Snell's law. A stack of non linear functions you say? Sounds like a neural network to me! Inference, or the forward model, is the optical simulation where given some input light, we compute the image formed. Training - or optimization - is finding the best shapes for lenses to focus light where we want it.

The magic is that we can pretty much use `torch.nn` and `nn.Module` directly, stacking layers like Lego bricks. Then, pass the whole thing through `optimize()` to find the optimal values for parametric surfaces, and designing lenses is surprisingly like training a neural network! Once this is implemented, you get 'for free' the massive power of modern open-source machine learning tooling: automatic differentiation, optimization algorithms, composability, GPU training, distributed training, and more. I strongly believe that writing code is a very powerful way to design lenses and this project is an exploration of that.

I want *Torch Lens Maker* to be to *Zemax OpticStudio* what *OpenSCAD* is to *SolidWorks*.
## Design principles

*Torch Lens Maker* design principles are:

* **Rotational Symmetry**
The full 3D system must be symmetrical around the principal optical axis. This allows the simulation to happen in 2D but generalize correctly to 3D. Rays that lie in a plane that does not contain the principal axis (sometimes called *skew ray*s) are ignored. 

Note that I personally still don't fully understand [how ray diagrams generalize to 3D](https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/836037/in-optics-how-do-2d-ray-diagrams-generalize-to-3d). If you are really good at optics and are reading this, please consider posting an answer there!

(By the way full 3D differentiable optics [has been done before](https://github.com/vccimaging/DiffOptics), and that paper has been a strong inspiration for this project, so huge thank you to the authors for publishing that work.)

* **No approximations**
The so-called *paraxial approximation* (sin(x) = tan(x) = x), the *thin lens equation* and other approximations are very widely used in optics. In fact, I've been frustrated with how in most material on optics, it's never really clear if approximations are used or not, making learning difficult. Everything in *Torch Lens Maker* is always geometrically accurate, up to floating point precision.

* **Sequential optical elements**
The order in which rays of light interact with optical elements must be known and fixed. Not knowing the order would require figuring out which surface is being hit at every step, which is computationally very expensive. By limiting ourselves to linear, sequential systems the complexity is manageable. It might be possible to implement a generic raytracer in fully differentiable PyTorch, complete with Bounding Volume Hierarchies and everything. But for optimizing the parametric shape of surfaces, this approach is best, I think.

This sequential requirement hasn't been a problem at all so far, especially with how easy it is to recursively nest PyTorch modules. In practice, *Torch Lens Maker*'s implementation describes a tree of optical elements in python code (which is very natural), and the simulation traverses that tree in depth first search order.

Also, things like apertures (small hole for some of the light to pass through) or rays that diverge too much and don't hit their target optical element is fully supported. This is thanks to the dynamic nature of the PyTorch compute graph, and enables amazing feats of optimization.

* **High quality software engineering**
The design of a software library is extremely important. The goal of this project is not just to design lenses and mirrors, but to enable anyone to do it with the maximum amount of correctness, verifiability and joy. This obviously means open-source code so you can collaborate on it with git, verify it, modify it and most importantly read it and understand it!

I think too often code is optimized for being easy to write, when being easy to **read** is the most important. Bringing best in class code quality to optical systems design is part of the vision for this project.

## The origin of this project

The origin of this project is double:

1. I wanted to learn Optics.

I attended online classes and read textbooks. While fun, I've been sometimes frustrated by approximations and general lack of rigor in the way the field is being taught. As someone with a strong software background, but a total noob in optics, approximations like sin(x) = x seem to make sense if you're Isaac Newton designing a telescope with pen and paper in the 17th century, but today I think non linear optimization is so remarkably powerful that we should start there. Teaching optics with ideal equations like 1/u + 1/v = 1/f or the lens maker equation that are never true in real life is in my opinion misleading (at least to me it was super confusing until I let go of it and embraced the non linearity of Snell's law)! Those equations should be presented as the over-simplified approximate but historically useful model that they are, not as Chapter 1 of how lenses work. It's not! Spherical aberration is not a part of physics! It's an engineering consequence of solving a non linear system too approximately!

Furthermore, I strongly believe that you only truly understand something once you've programmed a computer to do it. I am fascinated by optics, and *Torch Lens Maker* is a learning project for me. Every time I add a new feature it deepens my understanding of the physics of it. For example, what is an image? I know what an image is for a computer, it's a 2D grid of pixel data... right? Yeah sure, but in optics it's totally different! I have not yet found an optics textbook that rigorously defines what an image is. The best I got was in a Khan Academy video where it was said "an image is where rays of light converge". Still, I think it's more subtle than that (sometimes they don't converge, and still an image is formed)! My best understanding of it actually came when I implemented the `Image` class in *Torch Lens Maker*.

(As an aside, I think the question "what is an image?" might be to optics experts the same as "what is money?" is to economists).

In fact, now that I think of it, maybe writing a textbook on optics using code in python notebooks and forgetting all approximations to embrace the non linearity of Snell's law would be an interesting modern approach to teaching optics. If you were somewhat ambitious you might call that book *Structure and Interpretation of Optics*, but I'm not there yet ðŸ˜Š.

2. Recurse Center

From November 2024 to February 2025 I attended the Recurse Center, a technical retreat for programmers. At the Recurse Center, you become a better programmer by working at the edge of your abilities, learning generously and working on your own projects. *Torch Lens Maker* was my main project during my batch, and I was able to work on it full time, making great progress and having great fun! Now that my batch has ended, I'm looking for a way to keep working on it because I believe it has great potential. I don't want all lenses in the future to be designed with 5 figures closed-source commercial software, we can do better. Look at how machine learning enjoys state of the art open-source tooling. Let's do the same for optics!

I am looking for sponsorship, contracting or donations to be able to keep working on this project. If you are interested in sponsoring open-source development of *Torch Lens Maker*, please reach out or make a donation! Thank you!
